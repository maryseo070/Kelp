# Kelp README

Kelp is a full-stack, single-page web application clone of Yelp. It is a platform for users to share their experiences of coral reefs via reviews, ratings, and pictures. Along with these user-generated reviews, reefs are displayed on a show page with their relevant information to help provide a list of the best options available to users.
